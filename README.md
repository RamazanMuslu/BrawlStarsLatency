Overlay ping meter for aws-based online games. Like Brawl Stars, Clash Royale, etc. 

## About
BSMS is a free latency monitoring application.
You can track your real-time ping to your selected server on any part of your screen.
Supports 15+ AWS (Amazon Web Services) servers.
Does not interact with the game you are playing (no risk of being banned).
You can track the latency you experienced in the past.

BSMS (Overlay Latency) is completely free, open source, and ad-free. It's developed by me (Ramazan Muslu) and public volunteer.
